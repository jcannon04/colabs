        " The code and instructions for this workshop are written entirely in **Google Colab**, which is a free service by Google that lets you write and run Python code in your browser. It's built on **Jupyter Notebooks**, and there is no setup required. Colab gives you access to computing resources for free and allows you to easily share your work with others. It's designed to be straightforward to use, with guides and tutorials if you need help getting started. There are some basics that you need to know to follow along with this guide. If you are already familiar with Colab and Jupyter Notebooks, you're welcome to skip to the next cell.\n",

        "If not here is the basic information you'll need to get through this workshop. You can edit cells like this one by double-clicking to enter edit mode and start making changes. This is a text cell that supports markdown, HTML, and normal text. The other type of cell is a code cell, which you can use to write Python, shell commands, and other computer code. You can click Esc to enter command mode, and you can execute the code in any cell by hitting the play button in the top-left corner of the cell. Only the code in the cell that you run is executed, so you might run into problems if you run a cell that depends on code in a previous cell. If you get errors, running the code in previous cells may solve the issue. If you need additional help or would like to know more, here are some great resources to start with.\n",

Set SMART goals: Start by setting specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound goals. For example, \"I want to lose 20 pounds in the next 3 months\".\\n\\n2. Create a balanced meal plan: Focus on incorporating whole, nutrient-dense foods into your diet. Include a mix of lean proteins, such as chicken, fish, and plant-based sources, along with a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. Avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive snacking.\\n\\n3. Portion control: Pay attention to portion sizes and aim for balanced meals. Utilize tools like a food scale or measuring cups to ensure accurate portions.\\n\\n4. Regular exercise: Incorporate a mix of cardiovascular exercises, such as jogging, cycling, or swimming, to burn calories and improve cardiovascular health. Additionally, incorporate strength training exercises like weightlifting or bodyweight exercises to build muscle and boost metabolism.\\n\\n5. Stay hydrated: Aim to drink enough water throughout the day to stay hydrated and to help control hunger cravings. Replace sugary beverages with water or unsweetened herbal teas.\\n\\n6. Get enough sleep: Ensure you are getting adequate sleep each night as it plays a crucial role in your energy levels and overall well-being.\\n\\n7. Seek support: Consider working with a personal trainer or hiring a fitness coach who can provide guidance, create a personalized plan, and hold you accountable. You can also find support through friends, family, or online communities focused on fitness and weight loss.\\n\\nRemember, each person is unique, and it\\'s essential to listen to your body and make necessary adjustments along the way.

Based on your current weight and height, it would be helpful to focus on both weight loss and increasing your overall energy levels. Here's a three-step plan that can assist you in reaching your goals:\\n\\n1. Balanced Nutrition: To support weight loss and sustained energy, it's essential to focus on a balanced diet. Aim for a calorie deficit by consuming whole, nutrient-dense foods such as lean proteins (chicken, fish, tofu), fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil). Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Consider consulting with a registered dietitian who can personalize a meal plan based on your specific needs and preferences.\\n\\n2. Regular Exercise: Incorporate both cardiovascular exercises and strength training into your routine. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio, such as jogging, cycling, or swimming, every week. Additionally, include strength training exercises like weightlifting or bodyweight exercises to build lean muscle mass and improve your metabolism. A mix of both types of exercises will help you lose weight, improve energy levels, and increase overall fitness.\\n\\n3. Lifestyle adjustments: In addition to diet and exercise, there are a few lifestyle changes that can have a positive impact on your energy levels. Prioritize getting enough sleep (7-8 hours per night) to allow for adequate recovery and energy restoration. Manage stress through techniques like meditation, deep breathing exercises, and engaging in activities you enjoy. Lastly, consider avoiding or limiting the intake of stimulants like caffeine and alcohol, as they may disrupt your sleep patterns and overall energy levels.\\n\\nRemember that consistency and patience are key when working towards fitness goals. Celebrate your small successes along the way, and don't be too hard on yourself if you have setbacks. Stay committed, and over time, you will see progress toward your weight loss and energy improvement goals.

            "\n",
            "1. Balanced Nutrition: To support weight loss and sustained energy, it's essential to focus on a balanced diet. Aim for a calorie deficit by consuming whole, nutrient-dense foods such as lean proteins (chicken, fish, tofu), fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil). Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Consider consulting with a registered dietitian who can personalize a meal plan based on your specific needs and preferences.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Regular Exercise: Incorporate both cardiovascular exercises and strength training into your routine. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio, such as jogging, cycling, or swimming, every week. Additionally, include strength training exercises like weightlifting or bodyweight exercises to build lean muscle mass and improve your metabolism. A mix of both types of exercises will help you lose weight, improve energy levels, and increase overall fitness.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Lifestyle adjustments: In addition to diet and exercise, there are a few lifestyle changes that can have a positive impact on your energy levels. Prioritize getting enough sleep (7-8 hours per night) to allow for adequate recovery and energy restoration. Manage stress through techniques like meditation, deep breathing exercises, and engaging in activities you enjoy. Lastly, consider avoiding or limiting the intake of stimulants like caffeine and alcohol, as they may disrupt your sleep patterns and overall energy levels.\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember that consistency and patience are key when working towards fitness goals. Celebrate your small successes along the way, and don't be too hard on yourself if you have setbacks. Stay committed, and over time, you will see progress toward your weight loss and energy improvement goals. If you need further guidance or have specific questions, feel free to ask!\n"
